# Development

### Link to Deployed Website
If you used the stencil code, this is `https://<your GitHub username>.github.io/<name of your repository>`

### Goal and Value of the Application
The goal of this application is to be able to sort and filter through animes as well as being able to add them to your "Favorites"; additionally, there is an aggregator athat counts up the total number of seasons across all of the shows in your "Favorites" list (ie. if you have two shows that are 1 and 3 seasons respectively, the total number in the aggregator is 4 seasons). The value of this application is that it allows you to sort through 12 animes by the genre and subcategories they fall under (which is useful for me personally as well for keeping track of my shows!).

### Usability Principles Considered
In terms of usability, I was focused on 1) having an easy to follow layout and 2) having clear buttons so that users can intuitively understand what each button is meant to do (ie. sorting/filtering versus adding to favorites).

### Organization of Components
I have three components: Aggregator.js, ShowItem.js, and App.js. Aggregator.js is my aggregator component
